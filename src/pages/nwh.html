            SUPERHERO EXTRAVAGANZA!!! ⭐7
        </div>
            <div class="cont">
                Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!

            Idiotic childish movie  ⭐5
        </div>
            <div class="cont">
                I really do NOT understand the high score for this movie.
                The storyline is idiotic and childish with monsters and spider-men coming from different dimensions all because some spell from dr. Strange went bad.
                My God, what a piece of crap this movie... The special effects are as expected great but the rest is really a bunch of nonsense!
                I love Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk etc but this movie is really terrible and I wasted 148minutes precious time.
                Take my word for it: the best thing to do is to skip this movie and wait for something better to watch, which is not hard as there are not many movies as dumb as this one!
