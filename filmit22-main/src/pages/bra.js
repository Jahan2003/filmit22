                Where do I even begin? The writing is near perfect, the actors and characters are all amazing, the over-arching story just gets only better and better. This show is just a bullet train, this just goes and refuses to stop. It pulls no punches, everything that happens has all the impact. And honestly, there isn't a single bad episode. Every episode, yes even "Fly", serves a purpose, and honestly, shouldn't be skipped over upon first viewing. And for a show that ended in 2013, it's still relatively popular and beloved among people. Everyone I know still loves the show and loves it to death.
                There isn't much else to say, other than that this show is perfect. 10/10.

                I finished watching Breaking Bad 8 years ago and was blown away by how brilliant it was. Original story, great character building, comedy, drama... edge of your seat moments...this show has it all.
                After all these years I've started rewatching on Netflix and I'm every bit as obsessed with it now as I was back then.
                It is absolutely unrivalled television.
